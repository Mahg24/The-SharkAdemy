## Description

A few years ago i created a backend Api from [Academy](https://academy.polygon.us/) and and i did a lot of wrong stuff this project is a remake of that but with a lot of new knowledge.
Feel free to fork clone or copy this project and use it whatever you want, this is more a redemcion to myself (and for portafolio)
I will use [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) because i think is very cool to microservices
